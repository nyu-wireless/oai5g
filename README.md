# OAI 5G Tutorial

NYU Wireless has recently installed hardware for a basic 5G base station and core network based on the [Open Air Interface (OAI) stack](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g) and [NI / Ettus USRPs](https://kb.ettus.com/OAI_Reference_Architecture_for_5G_and_6G_Research_with_USRP).  This repository provides basic instructions for conducting simple experiments with the stack.
