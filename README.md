# OAI 5G Tutorial

NYU Wireless has recently installed hardware for a basic 5G base station and core network based on the [Open Air Interface (OAI) stack](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g) and [NI / Ettus USRPs](https://kb.ettus.com/OAI_Reference_Architecture_for_5G_and_6G_Research_with_USRP).  This repository provides basic instructions for conducting simple experiments with the stack.

## Architecture

## Basic Instructions 
*  [Creating an account and logging on the Nautilus network](./docs/login.md)
*  [Using a Remote Desktop](./docs/remote.md)
*  Modifying and compiling the code
*  Running a simple uplink and downlink throughput test
*  Recoding and parsing MAC, RLC, and PDCP logs
*  Using OAIBox for visual display

## Demos
